# create a Translator web application based on flask and celery
-using Flask,RadditMQ,SQL,Celery,css,html,ubuntu 18.04
-using Azure AI services [Translator API] to build intelligent applications infused with AI. 

This is about core concepts of building websites in Python by using the Flask framework. 

Typically, the core of a flask application is app.py, and the code calls Flask functions such as `render_template()`. 

Inject content into html templates programmatically by using Jinja, and how to use `@app.route()` to connect functions in your code to  routes that the application supports.

 By using Azure Translator service,the application can  translate text by using a few lines of code rather than by creating  own NLP/ machine learning model.
